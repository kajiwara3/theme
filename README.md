## Nothing Fancy

This theme began life as a copy of the [_s (Underscores)](https://underscores.me/) starter theme. We have added schema attributes and slightly modified the CSS files.

Some sample block editor styles are loaded, some functions are provided to check for Advanced Custom Fields and for ClassicPress.

## Requirements

* This theme was written in a WordPress 5.0+ environment with no concern for backwards compatitbility.
* This theme was written on a local server running PHP 7.2
* The short array syntax ( `[]` rather than `array()` ) requires PHP 5.4+
* Function files are namespaced and must be called accordingly in template parts.

## Extras

* Has a sample theme options page ready to begin developing.
* Has a the info page as an example for getting theme data.
